# Sensorflux backend compose

Sample backend based on InfluxDB + Grafana + Chronograf.

Note: mainly based on https://github.com/jkehres/docker-compose-influxdb-grafana.git . Full documentation of the underlying setup can be found there.

## Quick Start

To start the app:

1. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the docker host.
1. Clone this repo on the docker host.
1. Optionally, change the default credentials or Grafana provisioning.
1. Run the following command from this directory:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the app:

1. Run the following command from this directory:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Ports

Quickstart: http://localhost:3000

The services in the app run on the following ports:

| Host Port | Service |
| - | - |
| 3000 | Grafana |
| 8086 | InfluxDB HTTP |
| 8089 | InfluxDB UDP line protocol |
| 8888 | Chronograf |

Note that Chronograf does not support username/password authentication. Anyone who can connect to the service has full admin access.

## Volumes

The app creates the following named volumes (one for each service) so data is not lost when the app is stopped:

* influxdb-storage
* chronograf-storage
* grafana-storage

## Users

The app creates two admin users - one for InfluxDB and one for Grafana. By default, the username and password of both accounts is `admin`. To override the default credentials, set the following environment variables before starting the app:

* `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`
* `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
* `GRAFANA_USERNAME`
* `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`

The defaults can be found in the `.env` file.

## Database

The app creates a default InfluxDB database called `sensorflux`. This is also the database which the UDP endpoint in use feeds data into.

## Data Sources

The app creates a Grafana data source called `InfluxDB` that's connected to the default IndfluxDB database (e.g. `sensorflux`).
